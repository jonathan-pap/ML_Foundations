# Predicting house prices
In this module, we focused on using regression to predict a continuous value (house prices) from features of the house (square feet of living space, number of bedrooms,...).  We also built an Jupyter notebook for predicting house prices, using data from King County, USA, the region where the city of Seattle is located.

In this assignment, we are going to build a more accurate regression model for predicting house prices by including more features of the house.  In the process, we will also become more familiar with how the Python language can be used for data exploration, data transformations and machine learning.  These techniques will be key to building intelligent applications.

Follow the rest of the instructions on this page to complete your program.  When you are done, instead of uploading your code, you will answer a series of quiz questions (see the quiz after this reading) to document your completion of this assignment.  The instructions will indicate what data to collect for answering the quiz.

### Learning outcomes
- Execute programs with the Jupyter notebook
- Load and transform real, tabular data
- Compute summaries and statistics of the data
- Build a regression model using features of the data
